        <div className="space-y-4 text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          <p>
            Muretta was founded to address the new challenges that builders are facing in North America, particularly the rising costs of construction due to labor and material price increases.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our business model focuses on providing comprehensive architectural and engineering services that are seamlessly integrated into the design process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Empowered by a reliable supply chain, our strategy aims to streamline the construction process, ultimately saving both time and money.

          <p>
            Building Information Modeling (BIM) offers several key benefits through clash detection, which is one of the primary advantages of using this technology in construction projects. Clash detection refers to the process of identifying conflicts or issues in the design phase that might cause problems during construction.

            <div className="space-y-4">
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200">Early Issue Identification</h3>
              <p>
                Clash detection allows project teams to identify and resolve conflicts early in the design phaseâ€”before construction begins. This can include clashes between structural elements, mechanical systems, electrical layouts, and plumbing.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200">Cost Savings</h3>
              <p>
                By addressing conflicts before construction, clash detection minimizes the need for costly rework or modifications on-site. Fixing issues during the design phase is much less expensive compared to making changes during construction.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200">Improved Coordination</h3>
              <p>
                BIM facilitates better coordination among various disciplines involved in the project. With accurate and up-to-date models, teams can detect and resolve clashes between different systems before they are built.
              </p>

            <div className="space-y-4">
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200">Enhanced Design Quality</h3>
              <p>
                Clash detection in BIM ensures that the design is accurate and optimized for the real-world construction process, resulting in a more functional and well-coordinated building.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200">Risk Reduction</h3>
              <p>
                Identifying and addressing clashes helps mitigate risks related to safety, functionality, and performance. By catching these issues early, risks are minimized.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200">Better Communication</h3>
              <p>
                By providing a shared digital platform, BIM helps all stakeholders to collaborate and communicate in real-time, making it easier to resolve clashes and discuss potential solutions.
